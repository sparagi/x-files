These tests are based on the first edition (dated January 14, 1999) of the W3C Recommendations for Namespaces in XML (found at: http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xml-names-19990114/)

Naming schemes for examples will adhere to the following format: ns(section)o(subsection)example(N) 
where (section) is the section number in W3C's Recommendations for Namespaces in XML, (subsection) is the subsection number, and (N) is the Nth example in this section and subsection, starting from 0.

For instance: ns2o0example0 is the first example that can be found with regard to section 2.0 of the Namespaces in XML document.
