From RFC 2396 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt):

A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact string of characters for identifying an abstract or physical resource.

-- Need to fix Utilities-Character Escaping first.

	All my instance variables are decoded and ready for an application to use. If escape sequences appeared in the original URI, octets which are not acceptable as literals in that particular URI component may be present. Use >>printOn: to get the representation required by RFC 2396, in which these octets are escaped using $%. The representation generated by >>printOn: will match the original string from which the URI was constructed exactly, unless octets which are acceptable as literals in some URI component were (unecessaribly) escaped in the original string.

	I do not implement the following portions of RFC 2396:

-	Appendix E (Recommendations for Delimiting URI in Context)
-	Appendix F (Abbreviated URLs)

	Where the BNF and the examples in RFC 2396 do not agree, I comply with the examples. Where RFC 2396 conflicts with other RFCs, I comply with the more authoritative RFC for that topic. All known cases of conflict are documented in the relevant code and tests.

	The classes in the framework follow (existing classes used for instance variables or superclasses are elided).

	URI
		HierarchicalURI (has an Authority and a PathSegmentCollection)
		OpaqueURI

	Authority (determines the path namespace)
		HostAuthority (has a HostIdentifier)
		RegisteredAuthority

	HostIdentifier (identifies a network-accessible host)
		DomainName
		IPv4Address

	URIStream (understands encoding and decoding of URI characters)

	IllegalURIException (indicates a URI-related error)

	URITest (tests the classes in this framework)


	instance variables:

-	scheme		a String containing the scheme of a URI
-	fragment		a String containing the fragment of a URI
