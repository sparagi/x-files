An instance of me represents a Uniform Resource Identifier as defined by RFC 3986.  A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters that identifies an abstract or physical resource.  

Instance Variables

- scheme	a String containing the scheme of a URI
- userinfo
- host
- port
- path
- query
- fragment	a String containing the fragment of a URI

All my instance variables are decoded and ready for an application to use. If escape sequences appeared in the original URI, octets which are not acceptable as literals in that particular URI component may be present. Use >>printOn: to get the representation required by RFC 3986, in which these octets are escaped using $%. The representation generated by >>printOn: will match the original string from which the URI was constructed exactly, unless octets which are acceptable as literals in some URI component were (unecessaribly) escaped in the original string.
