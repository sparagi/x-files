My instances represent IP addresses in future, as-yet-undefined IP literal address formats, as described in section 3.2.2 of RFC 3986.

Presumably as these literal formats are defined, parsers will appear in subclasses of HostIdentifier.

Instance Variables

- versionFlag	a Bitmap representing a set of as-yet-undefined version flags
- address		a String representing an IP address in some future address format
