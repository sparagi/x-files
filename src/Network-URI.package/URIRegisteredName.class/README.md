My instances store registered names, as defined in section 3.2.2 of RFC 3986.   This section allows a very liberal syntax (as do I), but delegates deciding what is allowed for the purpose of host identification to the operating system (in this case Squeak).  I recommend using my subclass DomainName by default.
